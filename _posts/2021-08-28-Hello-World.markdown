**Hey!** This is the first official post, marking a week before we leave for six months. This small blog will serve as a living diary of our experiences for interested hosts, friends and family, and our future selves. We hope to update often and collect some interesting stories to share!

Over the past year or so, <a data-flickr-embed="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/194763409@N08/51816749715/in/album-72177720295906386/" title="Studying at Bequest Coffee Co."><img class="right-img" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51816749715_dabcb0621f_h.jpg" width="1200" height="1600" alt="Studying at Bequest Coffee Co."></a> we have been actively researching and planning this trip. A LOT was involved. We had to make sure we were up to date with local customs and traditions for each country, track emergency and embassy numbers, reach out to hosts, get the vaccines and testing needed, plan out how we'd share luggage, study local languages, create budget sheets, and research foreign policies and weather conditions. 

We spent most of our planning sessions at local coffee shops. We discovered this was the most effective way to get into the element. Every sucessful session yielded more excitement for the planning and research that remained. Sometimes I look back and think about how crazy it is that we've actually made it this far! I never would have guessed a couple of years ago that we would be in this position after preparing for so long. 

Both Alex and I are incredibly excited for what's to come and eager to share lots of pictures!
