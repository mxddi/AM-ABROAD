         <p class="about-both-info">Weâ€™re Alex and Maddi, two close friends who share a passion for nature, people, and exploration. Our story began in 2020 on a whim. For these past two years, we have been preparing for the journey of a lifetime. Motivated by an urge to explore, foster meaningful relationships and experience the diversity that different communities across the world have to offer, we decided to step out into the world. We will be leaving home in January 2021 to volunteer with host families across 3 continents and 8+ countries. Through volunteering opportunities on farms and in educational communities, we strive to make a long lasting impact in both our own lives and of the people we meet along the way. In some ways, we hope these experiences will help shape our cultural knowledge, environmental awareness, and overall willingness to face the unknown throughout our lives. In exchange, we are excited to share our abilities with those who are in need of some additional hands. We both believe that human connection and understanding is one of the most important parts of life, and we seek to share experiences and differences with others far from home.
